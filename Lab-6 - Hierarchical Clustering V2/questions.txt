1. Perform hierarchical clustering using given distance for a given dataset. analyze the performance using CPCC for various linkage measures. Identify optimum number of cluster using Silhouette index. 
(GPS Dataset1.csv). (10 marks)  
a. odd roll numbers (Euclidean distance)
b. Even roll numbers (Manhattan distance)
plot the dentogram (5 marks)
visualize the points using number of clusters identified using Silhouette index (Different colors for different cluster). (5 marks)
2. Perform chi-sqaure analysis for given gss dataset
a. explore the relationship between job preference and education status.(Job preference and education status are independent.)- visualize and interpret ( 5 marks) - Odd roll numbers
b. are people's preference in a job(like job security, high income, short working hours etc.) associated with their highest degree received? visualize and interpret ( 5 marks) - Even roll numbers
